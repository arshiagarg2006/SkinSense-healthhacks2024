We use advanced image recognition to screen patient-uploaded images and differentiate skin conditions. Our main focus relies on whether the image is MonkeyPox or not, and then our two trained models allow us to further examine the skin condition. This empowers individuals to seek medical guidance promptly, improving healthcare accessibility and contributing to more effective public health responses. Physicians will also benefit from SkinSense by using it to shortlist possible diagnoses for their patients promptly.
